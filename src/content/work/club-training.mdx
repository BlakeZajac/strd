role: WordPress development, API integration

stack: WordPress, WooCommerce, JobReady API, Events Calendar

overview: CTA Training is a nationally recognised Registered Training Organisation (RTO) offering courses across hospitality, health and community, and related industries. Working at Redback Solutions, I rebuilt their WordPress site from the ground up - frontend and backend - and rewrote their API integration so course enrolment runs through their JobReady system. The training platform is built on WooCommerce for course sales and tied into JobReady so enrolments happen automatically at checkout. 

challenge: The existing site depended on an outdated XML-based API integration that was hard to maintain and unreliable. With thousands of course enrolments going through WooCommerce, they needed a stable, scalable foundtation that could grow without breaking.

solution: The WordPress site was rebuilt from the ground up with performance and reliability in mind. The main technical work was rewriting the JobReady API integration into a modern, class-based JSON API so that when customers complete a WooCommerce purchase, they are enrolled in the right JobReady courses without manual steps. The integration looks up or creates the learner (party) in JobReady, checks for existing enrolments, and enrols them per product. The Events Calendar was integrated to handle ticketing for both in-person and online courses, so the team can manage their training schedule in one place.

highlights:
- Custom WordPress and WooCommerce build for a high-volume training platform and course enrolments
- API integration: Replaced the legacy XML integration with a modern JSON, class-based JobReady API
- JobReady: Automated course enrolment from WooCommerce checkout, including party creation/verification and duplicate-enrolment checks
- Events Calendar: Ticketing for in-person and online courses
- Custom mega menu and AJAX-powered search

impact: Since launch in February 2025, the platform has processed over 40,000 course enrolments in just over a year. The new API integration has remained reliable at scale and handles high transaction volumes without issues.

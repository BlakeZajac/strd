  - question: "Can you fix my existing WordPress site?"
    answer: "Yes. The right approach depends on how your current site is built. In some cases, targeted improvements can make a meaningful difference; in others, a more considered rebuild is the better long-term option. I will review your setup, explain what is realistic, and we can decide on the best path together."
  - question: "How much does a typical project cost?"
    answer: "Costs vary depending on scope, number of page types, and whether ecommerce is involved. After a short conversation and a clear brief, I will provide a written outline with pricing before you commit."
  - question: "How do we get started?"
    answer: "Start by sharing a few details about your business and what you need from your website. From there, we can schedule a call to clarify scope, timings, and next steps."
